toggle-lock-entity-row
======================

# THIS PLUGIN IS DEPRECATED
# I RECOMMEND USING [RESTRICTION-CARD](https://github.com/iantrich/restriction-card) WHICH DOES MORE THINGS BETTER

Avoid toggling entities by mistake in lovelace.

This will display a normal toggle with a lock symbol in front of it.
Clicking the lock will make it go away and enable the toggle to be manouvered for five seconds.
